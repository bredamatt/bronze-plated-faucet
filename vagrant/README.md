# vagrant

Because BPF development is better suited on a Linux box, it is not that straightforward to setup a suitable Linux environment on an M1 Macbook. Consequently, I use Vagrant with Docker acting like a hypervisor/provider. This means I need to specify the Linux image I want to use as well as the Vagrant file I use to bootstrap the machine.
